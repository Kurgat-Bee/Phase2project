***GROUP 3 PHASE 02***

***A PROJECT FOR THE BIG 5 STUDIOS***

We've decided to establish a new movie studio, but we're starting with little experience in film production. 

Our responsibility is to investigate movies that are currently at the box office. 

We'll then turn these insights into practical recommendations to assist the head of our new studio in determining which films we should focus on creating.

***We conducted an analysis on;***

❖	Popular genres; to determine which ones performed the best, compare recent trends on genre popularity.

❖	Audience demographic; to determine if certain languages have a better reach, and the contribution of the foreign market.

❖	Earnings- which movie made the most money; worldwide and domestic gross.

❖	Reviews and audience reception; to determine the best performing directors and writers.

❖	Production budget; to determine the impact budget has on the movie perfomance.

❖	Which studio has been performing best - top ten ; based on revenue generated.

❖	Release dates; to determine the best time of the year to debut.

***DATA USED***

We pulled data from various sources such as iMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, TMDB
