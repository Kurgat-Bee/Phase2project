***GROUP 3 PHASE 02***

***A PROJECT FOR THE BIG 5 STUDIOS***

We've decided to establish a new movie studio, but we're starting with little experience in film production. 
My responsibility is to investigate which genres and film types are currently performing well at the box office. 
I'll then turn these insights into practical recommendations to assist the head of our new studio in determining which films we should focus on creating.
